##### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
My code for the `AnimalShelter` class is well-structured and handles MongoDB database operations effectively. Each function, like `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`, is clearly defined, making it easy to understand what each part does. I've made sure to use descriptive names for variables and functions, and I've added comments throughout the code to explain how things work. This class can be reused in other projects, which saves me time and effort. If I need to make changes or add new features later on, it won't be a headache because of the modular structure. Looking ahead, I can see myself using this module in various ways, such as integrating it into a web app or for batch processing tasks. It's versatile and adaptable, which makes it a valuable tool in my programming toolkit. 



##### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
Approaching Grazioso Salvare's database and dashboard requirements involved a systematic breakdown of tasks, understanding client objectives, and applying technical skills effectively. For the database, I selected MongoDB for its suitability and implemented a Python module with CRUD functionality to ensure maintainability and adaptability. In dashboard development, I prioritized user experience, incorporating filtering options aligned with client needs. This project differed from previous assignments by emphasizing real-world client specifications and practical application, requiring a deeper understanding of stakeholder needs. In the future, I would continue to follow a systematic approach, focusing on thorough requirements analysis, best practices in database design, and clear documentation to meet client expectations efficiently.


##### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists apply computational principles to solve complex problems, and their work is essential for advancing technology across industries. In a project for Grazioso Salvare, computer scientists develop a software application that streamlines the identification and categorization of dogs for search-and-rescue training. By creating a user-friendly interface and database system, computer scientists enable Grazioso Salvare to efficiently analyze shelter data, identify suitable candidates for training, and enhance their rescue operations, ultimately saving time, resources, and improving their effectiveness in life-threatening situations.
